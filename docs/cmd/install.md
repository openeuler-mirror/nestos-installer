# nestos-installer install

```
Install NestOS

Usage: nestos-installer install [OPTIONS] [DEST_DEVICE]

Arguments:
  [DEST_DEVICE]
          Destination device

          Path to the device node for the destination disk.  The beginning of the device will
          be overwritten without further confirmation.

Options:
  -c, --config-file <path>
          YAML config file with install options

          Load additional config options from the specified YAML config file. Later config
          files override earlier ones, and command-line options override config files.

          Config file keys are long option names without the leading "--". Values are strings
          for non-repeatable options, arrays of strings for repeatable options, and "true" for
          flags.  The destination device can be specified with the "dest-device" key.

  -s, --stream <name>
          NestOS stream

          The name of the NestOS stream to install, such as "stable", "testing", or
          "next".

  -u, --image-url <URL>
          Manually specify the image URL

          nestos-installer appends ".sig" to find the GPG signature for the image, which must
          exist and be valid.  A missing signature can be ignored with --insecure.

  -f, --image-file <path>
          Manually specify a local image file

          nestos-installer appends ".sig" to find the GPG signature for the image, which must
          exist and be valid.  A missing signature can be ignored with --insecure.

  -i, --ignition-file <path>
          Embed an Ignition config from a file

          Embed the specified Ignition config in the installed system.

  -I, --ignition-url <URL>
          Embed an Ignition config from a URL

          Immediately fetch the Ignition config from the URL and embed it in the installed
          system.

      --ignition-hash <digest>
          Digest (type-value) of the Ignition config

          Verify that the Ignition config matches the specified digest, formatted as
          <type>-<hexvalue>.  <type> can be sha256 or sha512.

  -a, --architecture <name>
          Target CPU architecture

          Create an install disk for a different CPU architecture than the host.

          [default: x86_64]

  -p, --platform <name>
          Override the Ignition platform ID

          Install a system that will run on the specified cloud or virtualization platform,
          such as "vmware".

      --console <spec>
          Kernel and bootloader console

          Set the kernel and bootloader console, using the same syntax as the parameter to the
          "console=" kernel argument.

      --append-karg <arg>
          Append default kernel arg

          Add a kernel argument to the installed system.

      --delete-karg <arg>
          Delete default kernel arg

          Delete a default kernel argument from the installed system.

  -n, --copy-network
          Copy network config from install environment

          Copy NetworkManager keyfiles from the install environment to the installed system.

      --network-dir <path>
          Override NetworkManager keyfile dir for -n

          Specify the path to NetworkManager keyfiles to be copied with --copy-network.

          [default: /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/]

      --save-partlabel <lx>
          Save partitions with this label glob

          Preserve any existing partitions on the destination device whose partition label (not
          filesystem label) matches the specified glob pattern.  Multiple patterns can be
          specified in multiple options, or in a single option separated by commas.

          Saved partitions will be renumbered if necessary.  If partitions overlap with the
          install image, or installation fails for any other reason, the specified partitions
          will still be preserved.

      --save-partindex <id>
          Save partitions with this number or range

          Preserve any existing partitions on the destination device whose partition number
          matches the specified value or range.  Ranges can be bounded on both ends ("5-7",
          inclusive) or one end ("5-" or "-7"). Multiple numbers or ranges can be specified in
          multiple options, or in a single option separated by commas.

          Saved partitions will be renumbered if necessary.  If partitions overlap with the
          install image, or installation fails for any other reason, the specified partitions
          will still be preserved.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Advanced Options:
      --offline
          Force offline installation

      --insecure
          Allow unsigned image

          Allow the signature to be absent.  Does not allow an existing signature to be
          invalid.

      --insecure-ignition
          Allow Ignition URL without HTTPS or hash

      --stream-base-url <URL>
          Base URL for NestOS stream metadata

          Override the base URL for fetching NestOS stream metadata. The default is
          "https://nestos.org.cn".

      --preserve-on-error
          Don't clear partition table on error

          If installation fails, nestos-installer normally clears the destination's partition
          table to prevent booting from invalid boot media.  Skip clearing the partition table
          as a debugging aid.

      --fetch-retries <N>
          Fetch retries, or "infinite"

          Number of times to retry network fetches, or the string "infinite" to retry
          indefinitely.

          [default: 0]
          
      --secure-ipl
          Enable IBM Secure IPL
